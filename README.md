## üß© Problem Statement

**Problem Number & Title:**  
**Space Mission Fuel Optimizer**

Efficient fuel usage is crucial in space missions. The objective of this challenge is to determine the shortest path through a sequence of waypoints in 3D space to minimize total fuel consumption. The fuel cost between waypoints is directly proportional to the Euclidean distance traveled. This is modeled as a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run the Code

### 1. Requirements
Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., `g++`).

### 2. Prepare the Input File
Create a file named `waypoints.txt` in the same directory as the code. Each line should represent a 3D waypoint in the following format:


### 3. Compile the Code
Use the following command to compile:

```bash
g++ tsp_solver.cpp -o tsp_solver

./tsp_solver

### Sample Input 

Format :- <id> <x> <y> <z>

### Sample Output

Format :- 0 1 2 0 5.19


### Testcase 1

Input:
1 0.0 0.0 0.0
2 150.0 0.0 0.0
3 0.0 150.0 0.0
4 0.0 0.0 150.0
5 100.0 100.0 100.0
6 -150.0 0.0 0.0
7 0.0 -150.0 0.0
8 -100.0 -100.0 -100.0
9 200.0 200.0 0.0
10 -200.0 -200.0 200.0

Output:
1 6 8 7 10 4 5 2 9 3 1 1886.77
```

#### üßæ Dependencies
Only standard C++ libraries are used:
1. `<iostream>` ‚Äì For input/output operations.
2. `<fstream>` ‚Äì For file handling (reading and writing files).
3. `<vector>` ‚Äì For using dynamic arrays.
4. `<cmath>` ‚Äì For mathematical functions (e.g., `sqrt`, `pow`).
5. `<algorithm>` ‚Äì For algorithms like `next_permutation`, `reverse`.
6. `<limits>` ‚Äì For constants like `numeric_limits<double>::max()`.
No additional installations or external libraries are required.


# Simulation

We built a 3D simulation using the Three.js library within the Next.js framework to visually represent the spacecraft navigating through the optimized path of waypoints. The simulation offers a dynamic view of how the path is traversed in 3D space, enhancing understanding of the optimization result.

#### How to Run the 3D Simulation Code

```bash
Install dependencies:
npm install

Start the development server:
npm run dev
```

Go to http://localhost:3000 to view the 3D simulation.
