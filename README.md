## üß© Problem Statement

**Problem Number & Title:**  
**Space Mission Fuel Optimizer**

Efficient fuel usage is crucial in space missions. The objective of this challenge is to determine the shortest path through a sequence of waypoints in 3D space to minimize total fuel consumption. The fuel cost between waypoints is directly proportional to the Euclidean distance traveled. This is modeled as a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run the Code

### 1. Requirements
Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., `g++`).

### 2. Prepare the Input File
Create a file named `waypoints.txt` in the same directory as the code. Each line should represent a 3D waypoint in the following format:


### 3. Compile the Code
Use the following command to compile:

```bash
g++ tsp_solver.cpp -o tsp_solver

./tsp_solver

### Sample Input 

Format :- <id> <x> <y> <z>

### Sample Output

Format :- 0 1 2 0 5.19
